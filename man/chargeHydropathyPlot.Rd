\usage{
chargeHydropathyPlot(
  sequence,
  displayInsolubility = T,
  insolubleValue = 0.7,
  proteinName = NA,
  customPlotTitle = NA,
  pKaSet = "IPC_protein",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequence}{amino acid sequence (or pathway to a fasta file)
as a character string. Supports multiple sequences / files, as a
character vector of strings. Additionally, this supports a single protein
as character vectors. Multiple protiens are not supported as a character
vector of single characters.}

\item{displayInsolubility}{logical value, TRUE by default.
This adds (or removes when FALSE) the verticle line
seperating collapsed proteins and insoluble proteins}

\item{insolubleValue}{numerical value. 0.7 by default.
Ignored when \code{displayInsolubility = FALSE}. Plots the vertical line
\eqn{<H> = displayInsolubility}.}

\item{proteinName, customPlotTitle}{optional character string. NA by default.
Used to either add the name of the protein to the plot title when there
is only one protein, or to create a custom plot title for the output.}

\item{pKaSet}{pKa set used for charge calculations. See
\code{\link{netCharge}} for additional details}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to
\link[idpr:netCharge]{idpr::netCharge()},
\link[idpr:meanScaledHydropathy]{idpr::meanScaledHydropathy()} or
\code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}}}

\description{
This function calculates the average net charge <R> and the average
  scaled hydropathy <H> and visualizes the data. There are known boundaries
  on the C-H plot that seperate extended and collapsed proteins. \cr
  See Uversky (2019) \url{https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2019.00010} for
  additional information. This plot has been referred to as a
  "Uversky Plot".
