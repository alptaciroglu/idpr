\usage{
iupred(
  uniprotAccession,
  iupredType = "long",
  plotResults = TRUE,
  proteinName = NA
)

iupredAnchor(uniprotAccession, plotResults = TRUE, proteinName = NA)

iupredRedox(uniprotAccession, plotResults = TRUE, proteinName = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{uniprotAccession}{character string specifying the UniProt Accession
number of the protein used to fetch IUPred predictions.}

\item{iupredType}{character string. "long" by default. accepted types are
c("long", "short", "glob"). See "Prediction Type" information below.}

\item{plotResults}{logical value. TRUE by default.
If \code{plotResults = TRUE}, a ggplot of IUPred predictions is returned
If \code{plotResults = FALSE}, a dataframe of predictions is returned.}

\item{proteinName}{character string, optional. Used to add protein name
to the title in ggplot. Ignored if \code{plotResults = FALSE}.}

\value{
see plotResults argument.

\description{
This function makes a connection to the IUPred2A REST API based on the type
  of analysis and UniProt accession number. This requires the user to know
  the accession number of their protein and a connection to the internet.
  The results are then formatted to match output in the idpr package. \cr \cr
  Predictions are made on a scale of 0-1, where any residues with a score
  over 0.5 are predicted to be disordered, and any residue scoring below 0.5
  are predicted to be ordered (when using "long" and "short" predictions).\cr
  The output is either a graph (ggplot) or data frame of predictions.
  \cr\cr
  \strong{iupred()} is used for standard predictions of intrinsic disorder
  of an amino acid sequence. This is the core of predictions.
  Predictions vary by iupredType (details below)
  The results are either a ggplot or data frame of the fetched IUPred2.
  predictions.
  \cr
  \strong{iupredAnchor()} is used to combine the output of IUPred2 long with
  ANCHOR2 predictions. ANCHOR2 is a context-dependent predictor of binding
  regions for protein-protein interactions. The results are either a ggplot
  with 2 lines, one for IUPred2 long and another for ANCHOR predictions, or
  a data frame with both IUPred2 long and ANCHOR Predictions. Values are
  fetched by the IUPred2A REST API.
  \cr
  \strong{iupredRedox()} is used to predict redox-senstitive regions that may
  experience induced folding upon changing environments.
  This is a context-dependent predictor of disordered regions depending on
  a reducing (plus) or oxidizing (minus) enviornment. The results can be
  a ggplot with two IUPred2 long predictions, one for plus and another for
  minus enviornments, with redox senstitive regions shaded (if predicted).
  Alternativly, the results can be a data frame with both IUPred2 long plus
  and minus predictions as well as a column of logical values where a residue
  that is TRUE is predicted to be in a redox senstitive region. Values are
  fetched by the IUPred2A REST API.

\section{Prediction Type}{

  Information from \url{https://iupred2a.elte.hu/help_new} on 5.22.20
  Additionally, see the sources for futher details and source information.
  This is only relevant for iupred(). iupredAnchor() and iupredRedox()
  always utilize "long" for data in the REST API.
  \itemize{
    \item Long predictions of disorder (Default)
       \itemize{
         \item when iupredType = "long"
         \item Optimized for global predictions of disorder, specifically
           disordered regions over 30 amino acids in length.
         \item "long" is always used for iupredAnchor() and iupredRedox().
       }
     \item Short predictions of disorder
       \itemize{
         \item when iupredType = "short"
         \item Best for predicting small regions of disorder, especially
           in mostly structured proteins.
         \item Has adjustments for termini, since sequence ends are often
           disordered.
       }
     \item Structured predictions
       \itemize{
         \item when iupredType = "glob"
         \item Used to predict regions of globular folding.
         \item please see
